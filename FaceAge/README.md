Final Project repo for w207


This project aims to leverage AI to predict someone's age from their facial features. Age classification has applications in forensics, retail, marketing, crowd analytics, cosmetics, pretty much any consumer facing industry. We'll be comparing the performance between several models trained on the UTK Face Age Dataset. 

Data sourced from Kaggle :
