# W207-finalProject
Final Project repo for w207


This project aims to harness the power of AI to predict a person's age from their facial features. Age classification has applications in forensics, retail, marketing, crowd analytics, cosmetics, pretty much any consumer facing industry. We'll be comparing the performance between several models trained on the UTK Face Age Dataset. 

Data sourced from Kaggle :

Due to large file size of the orignal csv, I've omitted it here as well as the raw photos themselves. For sake of reproducability you can download the csv from the link above and run it through the EDA notebook. 
Model performance can be found in the Models.ipynb file in Notebooks.
